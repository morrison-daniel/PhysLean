# Polarization

In this file the real representation is used to develop representations of polarizations
such as the polarization ellipse, Stokes parameters and the Poincaré sphere for monochromatic
time-harmonic electromagnetic plane waves.

More general definitions that can be applied to a wider range of situations will be shown to
be equivalent to the definitions in this file where appropriate.

The material that was in this file has been moved to
`PhysLean.Electromagnetism.Vacuum.HarmonicWave` for better organization.
This file is kept because there is still some material to be added here in the future.
