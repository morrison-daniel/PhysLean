# Charges which are not pheno-constrained and do not regenerate dangerous couplings with Yukawas

In this module we give a multiset of `ℤ`-valued charges which have values allowed
by a `CodimensionOneConfig`, `I`, which permit a top Yukawa coupling,
are not phenomenologically constrained, and do not regenerate dangerous couplings
with one insertion of a Yuakawa coupling.

## Key results

- `viableCharges` contains all charges, for a given `CodimensionOneConfig`, `I`,
  which permit a top Yukawa coupling, are not phenomenologically constrained,
  and do not regenerate dangerous couplings with one insertion of a Yukawa coupling.
- The lemma `mem_viableCharges_iff` expresses membership of `viableCharges I`, i.e.
  that it contains all charges which permit a top Yukawa coupling,
  are not phenomenologically constrained, and do not regenerate dangerous couplings.
- The proof of `mem_viableCharges_iff` is via `viableCompletions` which
  contains all completions of charges which minimally allow the top Yukawa,
  which are not phenomenologically constrained, and do not regenerate dangerous couplings.

## Idea of proof

The idea behind the proof is that we show:
1. `viableCompletions I` is a subset of `viableCharges I`.
2. Adding a Q5 or a Q10 charge to an element of `viableCharges I` leads to a charge which is either
  not phenomenologically constrained, or does not regenerate dangerous couplings, or
  is already in `viableCharges I`.
The above two properties is then enough to show that `viableCharges I` contains all such charges.
## Implementation details

- Note that this file is slow to run, any improvements to the speed of this file
  will be very welcome. In particular working out a way to restrict by anomaly cancellation.

## Viable completions

We now prove that `viableCompletions I` contains all completions of
charges which minimally allow the top Yukawa, which are not
phenomenologically constrained, and which do not regenerate dangerous couplings
with one insertion of a Yukawa coupling.

This is broken up into a series of lemmas, but the main result is:
`viableCompletions_complete`.

## Closed under inserting charges

We now show that adding a Q5 or a Q10 charge to an element of `viableCharges I` leads to a
charge which is either not phenomenologically constrained, or does not regenerate dangerous
couplings, or is already in `viableCharges I`.
