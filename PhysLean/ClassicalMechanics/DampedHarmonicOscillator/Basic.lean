# The Damped Harmonic Oscillator

## i. Overview

The damped harmonic oscillator is a classical mechanical system corresponding to a
mass `m` under a restoring force `- k x` and a damping force `- γ ẋ`, where `k` is the
spring constant, `γ` is the damping coefficient, `x` is the position, and `ẋ` is the velocity.

The equation of motion for the damped harmonic oscillator is:
```
m ẍ + γ ẋ + k x = 0
```

Depending on the relationship between the damping coefficient and the natural frequency,
the system exhibits three different behaviors:
- **Underdamped** (γ² < 4mk): Oscillatory motion with exponentially decaying amplitude
- **Critically damped** (γ² = 4mk): Fastest return to equilibrium without oscillation
- **Overdamped** (γ² > 4mk): Slow return to equilibrium without oscillation

## ii. Key results

This module is currently a placeholder for future implementation. The following results
are planned to be formalized:

- `DampedHarmonicOscillator`: Structure containing the input data (mass, spring constant,
  damping coefficient)
- `EquationOfMotion`: The equation of motion for the damped harmonic oscillator
- Solutions for underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped cases
- Energy dissipation properties
- Quality factor and relaxation time
