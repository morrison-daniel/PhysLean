# Equivalent Lagrangians under Total Derivatives

## i. Overview

Two Lagrangians are physically equivalent if they differ by a total time derivative
d/dt F(q, t). This is because the Euler-Lagrange equations depend only on extremizing
the action integral, and total derivatives don't affect which paths are extremal.

This module defines the key concept of a function being a total time derivative,
which is essential for analyzing symmetries like Galilean invariance.

Note: Some authors call this "gauge equivalence" by analogy with gauge transformations
in field theory, but we avoid that terminology here since no gauge fields are involved.

## ii. Key insight

A general function δL(r, v, t) is a total time derivative if there exists a function
F(r, t) (independent of velocity) such that:
  δL(r, v, t) = d/dt F(r, t) = fderiv ℝ F (r, t) (v, 1)

By the chain rule, this expands to:
  δL(r, v, t) = ∂F/∂t + ⟨∇ᵣF, v⟩

For the special case where δL depends only on velocity v (not position or time),
this implies a strong constraint:
  δL(v) = ⟨g, v⟩ for some constant vector g

This is because:
1. d/dt F(r, t) = ∂F/∂t + ⟨∇F, v⟩
2. For δL to be r-independent, ∇F must be r-independent
3. For δL to be t-independent, the time-dependent part must vanish
4. The result is δL = ⟨g, v⟩ for constant g

## iii. Key definitions

- `IsTotalTimeDerivativeVelocity`: Velocity-only case, equivalent to δL(v) = ⟨g, v⟩

## A. General Total Time Derivative

-/

/-- A function δL(r, v, t) is a total time derivative if it can be written as d/dt F(r, t)
    for some function F that depends on position and time but not velocity.

    Mathematically: δL(r, v, t) = fderiv ℝ F (r, t) (v, 1)

    By the chain rule, this equals ∂F/∂t(r, t) + ⟨∇ᵣF(r, t), v⟩.

    This is the most general form of Lagrangian equivalence under total derivatives.
    The key point is that F must be independent of velocity. -/

    ∀ r v t, δL r v t = fderiv ℝ F (r, t) (v, 1)

## B. Velocity-Only Total Time Derivative

When δL depends only on velocity (the free particle case), the condition simplifies.

-/

/-- A velocity-only function that is a total time derivative must be linear in velocity.

    If δL depends only on velocity and equals d/dt F(r, t) for some F,
    then δL(v) = ⟨g, v⟩ for some constant vector g.

    This characterization comes from the requirement that:
    - d/dt F(r, t) = ∂F/∂t + ⟨∇F, ṙ⟩ = ∂F/∂t + ⟨∇F, v⟩
    - For the result to be independent of r and t, we need ∇F = g (constant) and ∂F/∂t = 0
    - Thus δL(v) = ⟨g, v⟩

    WLOG, we assume `δL 0 = 0` since constants are total derivatives (c = d/dt(c·t))
    and can be absorbed without affecting the equations of motion. -/
