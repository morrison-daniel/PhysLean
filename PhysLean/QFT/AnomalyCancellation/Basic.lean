# Anomaly cancellation conditions

## i. Overview

Anomaly cancellation conditions (ACCs) are consistency conditions which arise
in gauge field theories. They correspond to a set of homogeneous diophantine equations
in the rational charges assigned to fermions under `u(1)` contributions to the gauge group.

These formally arise from triangle Feynman diagrams, but can otherwise be got from
index theorems.

## ii. Key results

There are four different types related to the underlying structure of
the ACCs:
- `ACCSystemCharges`: the structure carrying the number of charges present.
- `ACCSystemLinear`: the structure extending `ACCSystemCharges` with linear anomaly cancellation
  conditions.
- `ACCSystemQuad`: the structure extending `ACCSystemLinear` with quadratic anomaly cancellation
  conditions.
- `ACCSystem`: the structure extending `ACCSystemQuad` with the cubic anomaly cancellation
  condition.

Related to these are the different types of spaces of charges:
- `Charges`: the module of all possible charge allocations.
- `LinSols`: the module of solutions to the linear ACCs.
- `QuadSols`: the solutions to the linear and quadratic ACCs.
- `Sols`: the solutions to the full ACCs.

## A. The module of charges

We define the type `ACCSystemCharges`, this carries the charges
of the specification of the number of charges present in a theory.

For example for the standard model without right-handed neutrinos, this is `15` charges,
whilst with right handed neutrinos it is `18` charges.

We can think of `Fin χ.numberCharges` as an indexing type for
the representations present in the theory where `χ : ACCSystemCharges`.

-/

/-- A system of charges, specified by the number of charges. -/
structure ACCSystemCharges where
  /-- The number of charges. -/
  numberCharges : ℕ

### A.1. A constructor for `ACCSystemCharges`

We provide a constructor `ACCSystemChargesMk` for `ACCSystemCharges` given the number of charges.

## B. The module of charges

Given an `ACCSystemCharges` object `χ`, we define the type of charges
`χ.Charges` as functions from `Fin χ.numberCharges → ℚ`.

That is, for each representation in the theory, indexed by an element of `Fin χ.numberCharges`,
we assign a rational charge.

## E. The quadratic anomaly cancellation conditions

We extend `ACCSystemLinear` to `ACCSystemQuad` by adding a finite number
(determined by `numberQuadratic`) of quadratic equations in the rational charges.

### F.4. Embeddings of solutions to linear ACCs into quadratic solutions when no quadratics

When there are no quadratic ACCs, the solutions to the linear ACCs embed into the solutions
to the quadratic and linear ACCs.

  no quadratic equations (i.e. no U(1)'s in the underlying gauge group). -/

## G. The full anomaly cancellation conditions

We extend `ACCSystemQuad` to `ACCSystem` by adding the single cubic equation
in the rational charges. This corresponds to the `u(1)^3` anomaly.

In many physical settings these conditions are derived formally from the gauge group and the

homogeneous forms on the space of rational charges.

as the cubic nor quadratic ACC is not linear. However it does carry the structure of
a `MulAction` of `ℚ`.

## I. Morphisms between ACC systems

We define a morphisms between two `ACCSystem` objects.
as a linear map between their spaces of charges and a map between their spaces of solutions
such that mapping solutions and then including in the module of charges
is the same as including in the module of charges and then mapping charges.

## J. Open TODO items

We give some open TODO items for future work.

One natural direction is to formalize how the anomaly cancellation conditions defining an
`ACCSystem` arise from gauge-theoretic data (a gauge group together with fermionic representations).
Physically these arise from triangle Feynman diagrams, and can also be described via index-theoretic
or characteristic-class constructions (e.g. through an anomaly polynomial). At present we do not
formalize this derivation in Lean, and instead take the resulting homogeneous forms as data.

(To view these you may need to go to the GitHub source code for the file.)

TODO "6VZMW" "Anomaly cancellation conditions can be derived formally from the gauge group
  and fermionic representations using e.g. topological invariants. Include such a
  definition."
