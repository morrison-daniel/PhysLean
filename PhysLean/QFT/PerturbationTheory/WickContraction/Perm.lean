# Permutations of Wick contractions

We define two Wick contractions to be permutations of each other
if the Wick term they produce is equal.

## TODO

The long term aim is to simplify this condition as much as possible,
so that it can eventually be made decidable.

It should become apparent that two Wick contractions are permutations of each other
if they correspond to the same Feynman diagram.
Please speak to JTS before working in this direction.
