# The Lorentz Current Density

## i. Overview

In this module we define the Lorentz current density
and its decomposition into charge density and current density.
The Lorentz current density is often called the four-current and given then the symbol `J`.

## ii. Key results

- `LorentzCurrentDensity` : The type of Lorentz current densities.
- `LorentzCurrentDensity.chargeDensity` : The charge density associated with a
  Lorentz current density.
- `LorentzCurrentDensity.currentDensity` : The current density associated with a
  Lorentz current density.
