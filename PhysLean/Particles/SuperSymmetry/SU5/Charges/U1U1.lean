# U(1) x U(1) charges

The aim of this module is to investigate the possible U(1) x U(1) charges that one can assign
to particles in the SU(5) model, whilst ensuring a phenomenologically viable theory.

The aim is to put an upper bound on the number of such charges, when the `U(1)` charges
are constrained to sit in certain finite sets.
