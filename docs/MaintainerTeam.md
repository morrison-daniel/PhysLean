# The Maintainer Team

The default policies around the maintainer team are those of Mathlib, and where conflict
or disagreement arises these are the fall-back.

## Role

The role of the maintainer team is to:

1. Give final reviews of pull-requests.
2. Help structure and guide the project.
3. Help foster a pleasant and active community around the project.

## Becoming a maintainer

Maintainers have research-level knowledge of physics or mathematics, and have
experience with either the PhysLean or Mathlib review process.

To become a maintainer, you either need an invitation from current maintainers, or
need to nominate yourself to a current maintainer.

## Term of a maintainer

A maintainer will serve for a period for one-year, which will renew unless they are
inactive for a period of 6 months before renewal or wish to step down (which they can
do at any point).
