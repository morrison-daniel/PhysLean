  <h1>Getting involved</h1>

  <p>PhysLean is a community project and we welcome contributions from everyone.
    There are many ways to contribute to the project, from helping with issues, to formalizing results,
    to creating informal results. Below are some ideas of how you can get involved.
    But feel free to contribute in any way you see fit and think you will have the most
    fun from!
  </p>

  <div class="timeline">
    <div class="step">
      <h2>Promotion</h2>
      <p>The easiest way to contribute is to promote the project, either
        by word of mouth or by sharing the project on social media.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <h2>Read through curated notes</h2>
      <p>You can contribute by helping by reading through the curated notes and
        suggesting improvements or corrections to names, doc-strings or Lean proofs.
        Any suggestion here is welcome!
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <h2>Help with issues</h2>
      <p>You can contribute by helping with open issues. These range from
        suggested formalizations, to infastructure changes needed, to Lean
        meta programming tasks.
      </p>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>The TODO list</h2>
      <p>The TODO list contains basic Lean or admin related tasks. Most of these
        are relatively small tasks like renaming lemmas.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="step">
      <h2>Golfing & Documentation</h2>
      <p>
        Golfing is the process of making the code more concise and readable, whilst
        documentation is the process of adding comments and explanations to the code.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Formalize informal results</h2>
      <p>Within Physlean are informal definitions and lemmas which need to be formalized
        into Lean. You can contribute by helping formalizing these results.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Creating informal results</h2>
      <p>If you have a background in physics and don't have the time or skills to
        formalize results into Lean, you can contribute by adding informal results
      (definitions and theorems) to the project. These are English written statements
      placed within the project.</p>

  <div class="step">
    <h2>Undertake a mini-project</h2>
    <p>There are a list of min-projects on the Lean Zulip. If you want to get your teeth
      really stuck into to formalizing physics, these are a great place for ideas.
